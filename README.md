DIY RSS
==================

Create an RSS feed of audio or video files for your podcasting client. This is a great way to quickly get a bunch of MP3s to your phone through your podcasting client. 

Paste each file that you want in the feed, give it a name, and they'll download to your podcast client.

You can put your files on any publicly accessible server or cloud storage.

Your RSS feed will be something like http://diyrss.com/abc123
