<h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
<ul id="faqs">
    <li><strong>My files are inaccessible.</strong> We don't host your files. If they're inaccessible, then you need to solve that issue yourself. We only organize them together in an RSS feed.</li>
    <li><strong>Take my feed down!</strong> You can do that yourself from your broswer. Visit <a href="@Url.RouteUrl("MyFeeds", null, Request.Url.Scheme)">@Url.RouteUrl("MyFeeds", null, Request.Url.Scheme)</a> from the same browser that created the feed.</li>
    <li><strong>I just made a feed, and it's not showing up in my podcast client.</strong>Beware that some podcast apps that use server-side processing may have their own delay in showing your files.</li>
